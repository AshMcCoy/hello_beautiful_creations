Things I would like to have: 

* If I run ahead of schedule- would like to have a modal pop up for login and registration on the landing page as opposed to redirecting to another html page to login. 

*Also would like to add a user account profile that they can see and update their information if necessary such as address, password, etc. 

*Would like the user to have a wishlist and can favorite certain items they view.
