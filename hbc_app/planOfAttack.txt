Things I would like to have: 

    * If I run ahead of schedule- would like to have a modal pop up for login and registration on the landing page as opposed to redirecting to another html page to login and logout

    *Also would like to add a user account profile that they can see and update their information if necessary such as address, password, etc. 

    *Would like the user to have a wishlist and can favorite certain items they view. 

    *Eventually add a testimonial/reviews page or listed on each item
